### Reference

Since references point to the values themselves and not to the variables, you cannot use one reference to change where another reference is pointed:

```
var a = [1,2,3];
var b = a;
a; // [1,2,3]
b; // [1,2,3]

// later
b = [4,5,6];
a; // [1,2,3]
b; // [4,5,6]
```

When we make the assignment `b = [4,5,6]`, we are doing absolutely nothing to affect *where* `a` is still referencing (`[1,2,3]`). To do that, `b` would have to be a pointer to `a` rather than a reference to the `array` -- but no such capability exists in JS!
